# 2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
#
#1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
#
#By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#This may be a small improvement. The Fibonacci series is:

#1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610...
#
#Now, replacing an odd number with O and an even with E, we get:
#
#O, O, E, O, O, E, O, O, E, O, O, E, O, O, E...
#
#And so each third number is even.  We don't need to calculate the odd numbers.  Starting from an two odd terms x, y, the series is:

#x, y, x + y, x + 2y, 2x + 3y, 3x + 5y link x,y,sum,x,y,sum,x....
